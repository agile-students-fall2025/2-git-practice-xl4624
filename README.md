I've worked with code that I characterized as bad before, but I've never really been able to articulate what specifically made it bad. From having to DFS up 4 levels of parent classes to find the definition of a method, to working with files with 15 different 5 line functions, I just felt that this experience was frustrating. This article helped me name those burdens, and even better, explained why certain principles that are taught to us like "high cohesion, low coupling" in very readable, plain English terms with thoughtful code examples. One of my favorite tips from this article is "Don't waste vertical space". It's not something that is often shared as a rule but makes a lot of practical sense.
